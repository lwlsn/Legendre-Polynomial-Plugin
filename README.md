# Legendre-Polynomial-Plugin
Distortion effect plugin with Legendre Polynomial waveshaping

The results from the solution to the Helmholtz wave equation in a spherical co-ordinate system:

(∇2 + k2)φ(r, θ, ψ) = 0

are known as Legendre polynomials.

These are used as waveshaping functions on a Distortion effect plug-in that uses Juce as a framework to implement them and gives some fun results.
